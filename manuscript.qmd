A collaborative workflow requires a collaborative work space that enables everyone participating to share and contribute to a project. \
There are multiple options for such a workspace, like Teams, Discord, or even over e-mail. when working with code however, online repositories on GitHub can be a good alternative.

In this tutorial we assume that you will be working with RStudio and have already downloaded R and Rstudio. In addition you are going to need to have the software Git installed and have an account in GitHub. If you need guidance for this you can find a helpful tutorial [here](1  Setting up your software environment – A Crash Course in R).

### What is a repository?

A repository is basically like a project box on your computer, where you collect all the files, data, graphs and code scripts from your project. \
Online repositories can be accessed from the internet and from any computer, while a local repository is only stored in a specific computer and cannot be accessed elsewhere. When setting up a collaborative work space its advantageous to have an online repository so that multiple people can contribute from their own computer to a shared repository, without having to send files by mail etc. In addition we can connect the online repository what a local repository which allows us to work and make changes using our own computer and then we can upload it to the online repository.

When creating a new project and you want to link your local project with an online repository, you can go about it to ways basicly.\
a) You can create the online repository and then clone it down to you computer\
b) You can create a local repository and then push it online to GitHub

we´ll go through both options here, starting with the online repository.

### How to create an online repository in GitHub

Creating an online repository in GitHub is fairly simple.

#### 1. Create a GitHUb account

Before you can create an online repository in GitHub, you need to have some essential infrastructure in play.
